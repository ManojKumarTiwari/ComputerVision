# Tools
  - Tensorflow Datasets - for quick implementation
  - Tensorboard - to visulize many aspects of training
  - What-If Tool - to compare models
  - tf-explain - Analyze decisions made by the network
  - Keras Tuner - automatic tuning of hyperparameters in tf.keras
  - AutoKeras - Automates Neural Architecture Search (NAS) across different tasks like image, text, and audio classification and image detection
  - AutoAugment - Utilizes reinforcement learning to improve the amount and diversity of data in an existing training dataset, thereby increasing accuracy
